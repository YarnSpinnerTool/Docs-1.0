There are two options for writing Yarn your scripts.

## The Yarn Editor

The [Yarn Editor]({{< ref "yarn-editor.md" >}}) is a tool that's custom-built for writing Yarn content in a visual way.

## Text Editors

You can also use any [text editor]({{< ref "text-editor.md" >}}) to write your code. 

{{<note>}}If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), we provide an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SecretLab.yarn-spinner) that adds support for Yarn Spinner.{{</note>}}
